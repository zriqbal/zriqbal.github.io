                                <h3>A bad miracle: Jordan Peele's "Nope" on creating spectales out of tragedy</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The trailers for Jordan Peele’s “Nope,” one of the most feverishly anticipated movies of the summer, have raised some intriguing questions. Is it a western? A horror film? Science fiction? Satire? Will it fulfill the expectations raised by Peele’s first two mind-bending, zeitgeist-surfing features, “Get Out” and “Us,” or confound them? I can now report that the answer to all of those questions is: Yup.
                                </p>

                                <h3>"Get Out" redefines Black horror through the terrifying reality of race relations in America </h3>
                                <p>
                                    What makes “Get Out” both exciting and genuinely unsettling is how real life keeps asserting itself, scene after scene. Our monsters, Mr. Peele reminds us, are at times as familiar as the neighborhood watch; one person’s fiction, after all, is another’s true-life horror story.

                                    Although "Hereditary" and cult-style films in general are not everyone’s cup of tea, there’s no doubt that the film has made its mark on the horror community. It was unique, refreshing, and jarring all at once.

                                <p>
                                    Described by its creator as “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains”, "Parasite" is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian – a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong’s back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond.

                                    Every member of the gang that comes to call themselves the Losers’ Club is natural and charismatic, especially the luminous Lillis as Beverly, the only girl in the group, and Wolfhard, whose wisecracking Richie easily walks away with the movie. Their ensemble scenes display the same sort of easy camaraderie that made Stranger Things such a hit for Netflix last summer.

                                    "The Blair Witch Project’s" principal photography cost a mere $35,000, but it went on to gross about $248.6 million at the box office—an indie film record at the time. How did its creators pull off such a monumental viral sensation when the term “viral” was barely mainstream? Like a lot of online phenomena, it was mostly an accident.

                                    Henry Selick's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Coraline is entrancing; it's among the most exquisite animated feature films ever made in this country. It is imaginative, daring and intelligent filmmaking devoid of Hollywood manipulations and greeting card sentiments.

Dani ultimately gets a measure of revenge—though even this, in Aster’s archly plotted script construction, offers Dani some mixed motives of her own, a measure of mercy along with her rage.
